Seorang balita masuk ke galeri dan tidak mau pergi. Orang tuanya mengikutinya ke galeri dan melihat setiap poster dengan cermat dan mendengarkan penjelasan selama kunjungannya. Sang ayah berkata bahwa ini adalah pertama kalinya ia mengetahui hal ini, dan ia terkejut mendengar tentang pengambilan organ secara hidup-hidup. Ia mengatakan akan memberi tahu lebih banyak orang tentang kejahatan ini.

Seorang siswa menerima brosur tentang pameran dalam perjalanannya ke sekolah swasta. Dia ingin melihatnya segera. Ibunya membujuknya untuk belajar lebih dulu dan mengunjungi galeri setelah pulang sekolah. Dia dan ibunya datang ke galeri bersama-sama.

Gadis itu terkejut dengan kekejaman PKT dan mengambil setiap brosur untuk dibaca kemudian dan untuk berbagi informasi dengan teman sekelasnya. Ibunya berkata bahwa ini adalah pertama kalinya dia mendengar hal-hal yang tidak dapat diterima seperti itu. Dia berharap kekejaman seperti itu bisa dihentikan secepat mungkin, dan dia mendorong penyelenggara untuk melanjutkan usaha mereka.",cQOq2Ih36EU,True

Direktur pusat perawatan terdekat melihat pameran dan berkata bahwa praktisi Falun Gong sangat baik. Sebelum datang ke pameran ia telah mendengar tentang beberapa kasus anak-anak Tiongkok yang hilang dan pengambilan organ hidup-hidup, dan ia sangat marah karena PKT telah membentuk rantai industri untuk melakukan kejahatan ini demi keuntungan.

Seorang pekerja medis di Pusat Medis Utara Saitama terdekat datang ke galeri setelah bekerja. Dia berkata: “Dengan menonton pameran poster ini, saya benar-benar percaya bahwa pengambilan organ secara hidup-hidup oleh PKT telah terjadi. Saya sangat menyesal bahwa pengambilan organ dari orang hidup yang tidak bersalah seperti ini seharusnya tidak pernah terjadi.”

Sebelum pergi, dia mengambil setiap materi di atas meja sehingga dia dapat memberitahu orang-orang di sekitarnya tentang kejahatan pengambilan organ secara hidup-hidup, sehingga lebih banyak orang dapat mengetahui fakta kebenaran dan membantu menghentikan kejahatan ini.

Yamada, yang bekerja di rumah sakit umum, mengerti sepenuhnya setelah melihat pameran dan mendengarkan penjelasan pemandu. Ia sangat berterima kasih kepada penyelenggara.

@user-in4mw3dz8s,2024-04-03T13:30:37Z,0,"A woman who was arrested in 2019 for her faith in Falun Gong recently revealed that she had four tubes of blood drawn and underwent a comprehensive physical examination following her arrest. One of her cellmates was once a nurse at an armed police hospital. The nurse said that forced organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners was an open secret when she worked there.

Ms. Li Ruihua, a native of Inner Mongolia in her 30s, worked in Beijing before her arrest. Her husband, Mr. Wu Rui, also in his 30s, is a native of Yichun City, Jiangxi Province. He worked as a training education teacher in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province before he was arrested at the same time as his wife.

Ms. Li went to Shenzhen to visit her husband in May 2019. Agents from the Luohu District Police Station broke into their home on May 28 and seized them. 

Ms. Li recently revealed that she was taken to a hospital for a comprehensive physical examination after her arrest. She was then admitted to the Luohu District Detention Center. A few days later, she was forced to give four big tubes of blood without being told why.

She asked other detainees if they had also been subjected to such a large amount of blood draw and comprehensive physical examination. They all said no. 

Ms. Li was later assigned to another cell, where a cellmate immediately realized the reason behind her suspicious blood draw. This cellmate, a former armed police hospital nurse, said it was probably to see if Ms. Li was healthy enough to be the next victim of the communist regime’s forced organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners. The nurse cellmate also noted that forced organ harvesting was an open secret in the hospital.

Ms. Li and her husband were indicted by prosecutor Liu Xiaona of the Yantian District Procuratorate on November 29, 2019. The Yantian District Court sentenced both of them to two years with a 3,000-yuan fine on April 1, 2021. Their appeals were soon rejected and they were ordered to serve time at the Yantian District Detention Center. 

The couple were released on May 29, 2021.

The horrendous crime of the state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting was first revealed in March 2006, when a woman claimed that as many as 4,000 Falun Gong had been killed for their organs at the hospital in which she had worked. She also said that her husband, a surgeon at the same hospital outside the northeastern city of Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, had disclosed to her that he had removed cornea from the living bodies of 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners. 

Since then, mounting evidence from witnesses and Chinese physicians has revealed that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been killed for their organs, which are sold and transplanted at enormous profit in the transplant trade.

@user-cf5zk3gh8x,2024-04-01T23:46:48Z,0,"On October 27, 2023, the Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung (abbreviated as Krone) published an online report titled “Live Organ Harvesting as a Billion-Dollar Business,” exposing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s live organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners. The report also quoted human rights lawyer David Matas and called on Austria to “not become an accomplice of China.” Krone is Austria’s largest daily newspaper, with a circulation of more than 1.7 million readers.


The Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung published an online report titled “Live Organ Harvesting as a Billion-Dollar Business.” (Screenshot of the website)

The article pointed out the huge discrepancy between the organ transplant data released by the Chinese regime and the data compiled through independent investigations. The article quoted Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas: “In early investigations, we found that the number of transplants was not 10,000 per year (data from the Chinese regime), but 60,000. Later, this number was no longer 60,000, but 100,000.”

The article then quoted the 2023 Special Report by Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH), expressing doubts about the CCP’s statement on the source of transplanted organs. The Chinese regime claims that “all organs come from donations.” If you ask relevant authorities how to explain the difference between the low donation rate and the high transplant number, they will say that some organs are obtained from victims of accidents. Matas responded with the rebuttal: “Organ transplants can be planned, but accidents cannot be planned.”

The article also raised doubts about another claim made by the Chinese Communist regime that organs come from executed prisoners. The article quoted Matas’s view: “Hepatitis B is common among prisoners in China, which prevents them from donating organs. Global pressure on China to abolish the death penalty means that it is now more difficult to pass a death sentence.”

The article clearly states that the CCP regards Falun Gong practitioners as a target group for organ sources. “As Matas said, Falun Gong practitioners are the largest victim group in terms of numbers. In 1999, as many as 100 million people belonged to this practice group. Most Falun Gong practitioners are very healthy and can be found all over the country.” “Falun Gong [human organs from practitioners] is a ‘gold mine’ and a new ‘source of income.’ Organ transplantation has become a billion-dollar business in China.”

The article also analyzed the political reasons why the CCP persecutes Falun Gong practitioners: “The persecution is also politically motivated because the organization is very popular, but it is not a communist organization.”

After a thorough analysis of the allegations that the CCP harvests organs from living Falun Gong practitioners, the article quoted Matas and called on Austria not to become an accomplice of the CCP. “If Austrians do not want to become China’s accomplice, they must ban their citizens from going to China for organ transplants.”

The article also pointed to the importance of passing legislation to discourage illicit organ harvesting. In 2015, Austria signed the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking Human Organs. Matas said that the agreement obliges countries to enact laws criminalizing conspiracy to traffic organs. However, the agreement has not been approved by the Austrian Parliament. If Austria passes this legislation, its citizens will not be able to legally go to China for organ transplantation. According to Matas, there are currently 20 countries that have enacted such laws. “But there are 193 countries in the world, so there’s still a long way to go.”",cQOq2Ih36EU,True

@johnpearson1258,2024-04-01T21:09:02Z,0,"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",cQOq2Ih36EU,True

But these highlights don’t do the fight justice. 
Cruz is easily beatable with a good jab and lateral footwork. Rolly won a couple rounds just using the 1-2 and moving. It isn’t a pretty fight, but it banking rounds and is a sure fire way to win. Cruz’s previous opponent survived all 12 rounds using his length behind his jab and just moving. Not letting Cruz plant his feet to throw those wild hooks is a major flaw in his fight game. Haney would easily beat Cruz. So would teofimo or Shakur.",cQOq2Ih36EU,True

The Bible says we are saved by believing in the Gospel by realising we are sinners Romans 3:23 and hell is the result of our sins Romans 6:23.
And to go to heaven we need to be perfect Revelation 21:27. But God says we can't earn our salvation because we aren't perfect but we can be saved through the blood of Jesus alone Ephesians 2 8 9 so we  have it by Grace.  We simply believe on Jesus Christ's   death burial and resurrection saved us. 2 Corinthians 5:21 and 1 Corinthians 15: 1- 4.
And it's only by believing John 3:16, John 6:47. And from this we know Jesus alone saved us from our sins  not by our works as Ephesians shows but by Grace through Faith in Him.
And we can know we are saved through 1 John 5:12-13.

@d-boogiewitdagoodies5849,2024-03-31T15:46:20Z,0,"Pitbull couldn’t do this to Tank but you got bias fans claiming he did just this very thing minus the stoppage😂😂😂
Tank outboxed Pitbull beautifully but bc Pitbull was the aggressor he “Won”. Give me a break, but that lil mf can fight. Tanks defense was just that good and he was able to move and avoid getting hit most of the time but Pitbull did catch him and counter him good. 
But just bc you won a few rounds doesn’t mean you won the fight. I like Pitbull, I just don’t think he could beat a 2 handed Tank or should I say make it to the final bell like last time, too much skill. A fighter that can outthink him is too dangerous for Pitbulls career and that’s why he turned down the fight with Shakur bc he didn’t wanna chase him all night and possibly lose on points.",cQOq2Ih36EU,True

Rolly has no boxing technique. Can't recall ever seeing him throw any combinations. No defense either. Bet you he doesn't even watch tapes on his opponents. He ain't trying to win, he's trying to get paid. People are going to pay just to see him get his a$$ kicked. When he confronts a real boxer, he never wins. Real boxers know he can't box.

Broner did the same thing also.

I am glad Pitbull won! Hopefully Rolly comea back but with out being so flat footed and with more head movement. He relies on his power punches so much that he exposes himself too much and does not move his head enough.

I dont believe Rolly is a terrible fighter he can do better than that.

I support both fighters regardless who talks more or less crap.

They are both young and have a lot of learning and growing to do.

Rolly will come back hopefully qith no injuries though so there arent any excuses.

Clearly his right arm was not 100% and we all know Rolly will want a rematch in the future all he needs to do is focus more maybe even switch trainers.

Unfortunately, he's been pigeonholed into a character or role by the selfish whims of society, which has distorted his public image. He extends warm wishes to everyone for Easter, yet he's met with boos. It seems like many in that arena are quick to judge, forgetting their own flaws. It's disheartening to witness such behavior, as it reflects a lack of empathy and compassion. We should strive to treat others with kindness and understanding, regardless of their circumstances.

@MrTheHeadlines,2024-03-31T04:15:44Z,0,I just wanna say Tim lost that fight fair and square because it’s like first of all why you rushin in with your head down like that you should know not to do that at this level also blood happens all the time in boxing matches you gotta be able to fight through that and fundora was sittin at home on the couch when he took this fight imagine if he had a full camp go train for Tim also since when in boxing did we start judging the outcome of a fight based on the first 2 rounds for the real boxing fans how many times has a fighter came in donating the first 2 rounds and end up losing the fight like I don’t like how everyone just assumed Tim would have won if he didn’t get cut based off the first 2 rounds,cQOq2Ih36EU,True
